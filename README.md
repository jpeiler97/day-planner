# day-planner

For this assignment I was required to modify an HTML/CSS file and link a Javascript file to create a wor kday (9-5) hourly planner. Thankfully, Bootstrap made formatting and styling the time blocks element quick and simple. The main challenge was ensuring the logic behind saving the tasks and color-coding the time blocks would work.
